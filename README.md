# LUNG-CANCER-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
The **Lung Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning** project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of lung cancer. It uses medical features like demographics, symptoms, and scan results to build predictive models. The goal is to assist doctors in early detection.
